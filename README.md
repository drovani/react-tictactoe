# Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial

This started with the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) on building a Tic Tac Toe game. Once I reached the end, I then worked on some of the "extra credit" suggestions along with some ideas I had.

1. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
1. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
1. Refactor history to be an event log instead of the board's state after each click.
1. Allow for arbitrary dimensions instead of just a 3x3 board.
1. Determine win condition formulaically instead of hardcoded states.
1. Added display of coordinates in the Undo buttons
1. Highlight the squares that triggered a win condition.
